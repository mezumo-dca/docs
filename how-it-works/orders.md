# Orders

For creating a new order, you need to choose:

* Which token you want to buy
* Which token you will be selling in exchange
* How much you want to swap in total
* Over how many days you want to spread the purchases

After creating the order, the swaps will be done automatically every day. You can claim the amounts that have already been swapped at any time or you can cancel the whole thing and get the swapped tokens up to that point plus the remaining tokens that haven't been swapped yet.

For now, we only support cUSD, cEUR, CELO and WETH, but we'll be supporting more tokens soon.
