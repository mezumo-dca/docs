# Fees

There are two different kind of fees: Gas fees and Protocol fees.

## Gas fees

These are the fees that are paid to send transactions in the Celo network. You will need to pay gas fees for:

* Creating a new position.
* Claiming the swapped tokens.
* (Optional) Cancelling a position before time.

Notice that no gas fees are paid for each swap, the swappers pay for those.

## Protocol fees

Mezumo charges a 0.4% fee on each swap. No fees are charged for creating positions, claiming tokens or cancelling positions.

As an example, if Alice creates an order to swap 5 cUSD for CELO every day, and assuming the price of CELO is `1 CELO = 2 cUSD`, then we will only swap `5 - 0.4% * 5 = 4.98 cUSD` each day and Alice will accrue `2.49 CELO` daily.
