# What is Mezumo?



Mezumo is a decentralized tool that allows anyone to buy tokens using a [Dollar-Cost Averaging](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp) (DCA) strategy.

It involves splitting the purchase over many days instead of doing a single big one. This means the price at which you buy is the average price over the time period, which helps fight market volatility.

Mezumo is available on Celo: [https://mezumo.xyz/](https://mezumo.xyz/)
